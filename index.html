							<p>Scott Sautter was born at a very young age to a very middle class family consisting of one father, one mother, and one older brother.  He came into the world at a hospital located in the heart of Raleigh, North Carolina. The first in his family to be born into North Carolina, but not the last.  At the young age of whatever age someone is in 4th grade Scott's family moved from Raleigh all the way to Apex, North Carolina. It may have been a meer 20 minute drive, but you'd be surprised by how your entire world can differ while only being 20 minutes away.</p>
	
							<p class="second-p">While living in Apex, Scott completed elementary school, middle school, and high school at Apex Elementary/Middle/High (respectively). After graduating from Apex High in 2004, Scott attended undergrad at East Carolina University where he double majored in criminal justice and philosophy. Why? He figured criminal justice would help him with his ultimate goal of going to law school and becoming an attorney, and, for some reason, he just enjoyed philosophy. I know what you're thinking, "Man, what a smart guy taking criminal justice like that to help him out with law school." He thought the same thing, but hindsight renders most men foolish. Fortunately, taking philosophy helped Scott learn how to construct logical arguments which did aid his law school tenure at Campbell University, and, eventually, his coding career.</p>
							<p>Since law school Scott has stayed around the Raleigh area where he started a family with his beautiful wife Tammy, and wonderful son Toby.  He loves to play the drums and has performed in various bands all around North Carolina. He also throws darts in the Raleigh Dart League. Plus, he's really cool in sorts of ways and knows all sorts of things. Just ask him.</p>
